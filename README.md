## Project Title
# StudentMoverAlpha
---------------------------

## Project Description
This is the alpha release of our StudentMover app. It shows the basic navigation and UI that the finished product should have.

## Usage Instructions
After downloading the file and running the app on the emulator. The only note we want to make is that for the recyclerView, you can scroll down by clicking with the mouse and moving up.

## Known Bugs/Problems
The UI is not uniform. For example, the View My Trips does not have the same recyclerView as findTrips. The reason is that we developed our parts seperately, and must work on making everything uniform across the app.
Another bug is that the toast that is set up in Find Trips, does not display properly. We are unsure why. 

## Areas you would like feedback on
We would like feedback pertaining the overall layout of the app, and whether or not there are any apparant issues, or things that look like they will be issues in coding the final app.
